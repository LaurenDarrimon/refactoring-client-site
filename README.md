## Description

The "HoriSEOn Digital Marketing" website was a beautifully styled, functioning website, with some minor glitches and was not fully accessible. This project upgraded and improved the website's code for accesibilty and usability.

## Built With

* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp)


## Methods 

The main issue was that the site was not fully acesssible, since it lacked many features designed to make a website acessible to screen readers and other accesible devices. I added a site title and desriptive alternate image attributes. I replaced generic html with semantic html elements so that the structure of the page can be understood and read from the code without the user seeing the styling. I made the navigatin fully functional. Also, much of the code on the back end was redundant and over worked, so I simplified, consolidated, and added in comments in both HTML and CSS to explain the newly cleaned up code!
