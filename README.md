## Description

The "HoriSEOn Digital Marketing" website was a beautifully styled, functioning website, with only some minor glitches. This project upgraded and improved the website' code for accesibilty and usability.  


## Methods 

The main issue was that the site was not fully acesssible, since it lacked many features designed to make a website acessible to screen readers and other accesible devices. I added a site title and desriptive alternate image attributes. I replaced generic html with semantic html elements so that the structure of the page can be understood and read from the code without the user seeing the styling. I made the navigatin fully functional. Also, much of the code on the back end was redundant and over worked, so I simplified, consolidated, and added in commets to explain the newly cleaned up code!
